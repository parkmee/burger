# burger
This application, while simple in form and function, successfully demonstrates the use of custom object-relational mapping (ORM) and API routing based on a MySQL relational database and an express server intialized through Node.js to display, add, and update persistent data to all users. Express handlebars were implemented for templating HTML webpages, streamlining programming for data display on the front-end. Deployment on Heroku supports live updates from multiple users simultaneously. An instance of JawsDB was utilized as a Database as a Service (DBaaS) to deploy the MySQL schema on Heroku.
